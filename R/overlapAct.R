#' Calculate overlap of activation (Maitra's adaptation of Dice).
#'
#' Function to calculate the overlap of activation of two binarized images.
#' The formula is an adaptation of the Dice overlap, suggested by Maitra in 2010.
#'
#' @param bin_map1 the first binarized (thresholded) map
#' @param bin_map2 the second binarized (thresholded) map
#'
#' @return Numeric value: measure of overlap.
#'
#' @details
#' The measure is the number of hits (e.g. voxels) intersecting in both images
#' divided by the sum of the number of hits in each image minus its intersection again:
#' \deqn{V_{a,b}/(V_a + V_b - V_{a,b})}
